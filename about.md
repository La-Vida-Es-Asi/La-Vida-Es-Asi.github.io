I am a Software QA Engineer with a passion for learning.  I love math, science, technology, & basically anything that makes me say *WOW*.  I am passionate about what I do!  I feel a calling to help empower others (especially women & minorities!) to look beyond their perceived potential to stretch above & beyond the limits of whatever it is they THINK they can do to achieve instead what they actually CAN do.  I hope in the future to establish a foundation to help spread the love around for the <3 STEM fields <3 and to help others gain interest in these areas.  This includes some scholarships!  I'm a busy mom of 3 boys & so I know what it is to be a mom/employee/student all at once - This is why I want to help others reach their dreams, as I've also been so blessed to be able to do myself.
