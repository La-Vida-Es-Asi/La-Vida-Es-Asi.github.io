I am a Software QA Engineer with a passion for learning.  I love math, science, technology, & basically anything that makes me say *WOW*.  I am passionate about what I do!  I feel a calling to help empower others (especially women & minorities!) to look beyond their perceived potential to stretch above & beyond the limits of whatever it is they THINK they can achieve instead what they actually CAN achieve.  I hope in the future to establish a foundation to help spread the love around for the <3 STEM fields <3 and to help others gain interest in these areas.  This includes some scholarships!  After all, math/sci/tech is AWESOME and really just doesn't always get enough credit for being so.  I so dislike seeing such bright young people out there who are intimidated by these topics instead of letting their guard down enough to be enthralled by them.  This needs to change & I hope to take part in a movement to do so!  On the other side of things, I'm a busy mom of 3 boys & so I know what it is to be a mom/employee/student all at once.  It was the experience of putting myself through 10 years of Computer Science in college which has really lit a fire under my behind to help others reach their dreams.  That - is my biggest goal right now.
